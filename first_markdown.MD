# This is Markdown 
(Ctrl + Shift + P)  
An empty line to separate text lines  
And two spaces at the end of the line if I want to keep them in the same paragraph

# Heading

## And smaller heading

### I'm 

#### So

##### Tired

Double * for **bold** and just one for *italics*

<mark>highlight</mark> this is written in HTML (still need to understand the border between HTML and md)

X<sup>2</sup>, H<sub>2</sub>O: markdown seems to support HTML syntax

Now I want to write some code in JavaScript

```js
// You can use Google Earth Engine both in JavaScript
```
```py
# Or in Python
``` 

``` R
Also in R
```
